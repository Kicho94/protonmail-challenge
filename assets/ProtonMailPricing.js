In addition to email end-to-end encryption, we also use highest strength 4096-bit SSL certificates issued in Switzerland and full disk encryption. For added privacy, we don't use cloud hosting, but instead we own and manage our own server and network infrastructure. Our primary datacenter is located in a bunker 1000 meters under the Swiss alps. When it comes to security, we do not make compromises, regardless of the cost. ${<a href="https://protonmail.com/security-details">Learn more about ProtonMail security here</a>}.`,

We control all traffic from our servers up to the main Swiss point of presence in Zurich, preventing many forms of data interception. ${<><br></br><br></br></>}We have also invested heavily in DDoS protection to make ProtonMail the only encrypted email provider that is capable of resisting large scale DDoS attacks.
